		<h1>Hi, I'm Chloe.</h1>
		<img src="face.JPG" width=30% align="right">
		
		<p>I am a Full-Stack developer and helping multiple businesses to PR their own unique colors.
		I've always wanted to be a creator, and even when I was working at a corporate finance job,
		I kept creating inspiring contents via my personal Youtube Channel and writing essays about career choices.<br>
		I am an amateur boxer and yogi, and I'm super interested in spirituality, meditation, and mental health.
		(I was so close to apply for Master's in Psychology or get a Yoga Teacher Training course at Bali, Indonesia.)
		I also love music. I played bass throughout my college years in Yonsei University, South Korea.
		I believe in the power of visual arts and contents, and convinced that it really can have positive impacts to the world.
